One of the most common questions we get from S-Corp owners: **"How much should I pay myself?"**

The answer affects your tax bill, cash flow, and IRS audit risk. Get it wrong, and you could overpay taxes by thousands—or face penalties for paying yourself too little.

## The Two Ways to Pay Yourself (S-Corp)

When you own an S-Corp, you have two options for taking money out:

### 1. W-2 Salary
- Subject to payroll taxes (15.3% up to wage base)
- Required for anyone doing "meaningful work" in the business
- Deductible business expense
- Reported on W-2

### 2. Distributions
- NOT subject to payroll taxes
- Reported on K-1
- Only available after paying reasonable salary
- Limited by equity basis

**The tax savings come from taking as much as possible as distributions instead of salary—but there's a catch.**

## The "Reasonable Compensation" Requirement

**The IRS rule:** You must pay yourself a reasonable salary for the services you provide *before* taking distributions.

Pay yourself too little salary, and the IRS may reclassify distributions as wages (plus penalties and interest).

## What Is "Reasonable"?

**The IRS considers:**
1. Training and experience
2. Duties and responsibilities
3. Time devoted to business
4. Dividend history
5. Payments to non-shareholder employees
6. Timing and manner of paying bonuses
7. What comparable businesses pay for similar services
8. Compensation agreements
9. Use of a formula to determine compensation

**General benchmarks (service businesses):**
- 40-60% of net income as salary
- Remaining 40-60% as distributions

**Example:**
- Net income: $150K
- Reasonable salary: $70-90K
- Distributions: $60-80K

## WA vs. OR: Different Strategies

### Washington (No State Income Tax)
**Strategy:** Minimize salary, maximize distributions
- Distributions are not subject to state tax (because there is none)
- Pure federal SE tax savings
- More aggressive salary/distribution split works

**Example:**
- Net income: $150K
- Salary: $70K (47%)
- Distributions: $80K (53%)
- State tax on distributions: $0

### Oregon (State Income Tax)
**Strategy:** Still beneficial, but less dramatic savings
- Distributions are subject to OR income tax (9.9% top rate)
- Federal SE tax savings still significant
- Slightly more conservative split recommended

**Example:**
- Net income: $150K
- Salary: $80K (53%)
- Distributions: $70K (47%)
- State tax on distributions: ~$6,900

**Bottom line:** S-Corp still worth it in Oregon above ~$80K net income

## Industry-Specific Guidance

Different industries have different "reasonable" benchmarks:

### Consultants / Solopreneurs
- High-skill, personal services
- Salary typically 50-70% of net income
- IRS scrutiny is higher (harder to argue distributions are "return on capital")

### Contractors / Trades
- Capital-intensive business
- Salary can be 40-50% of net income
- Equipment and crew justify more distributions

### Healthcare Providers
- Professional services
- Salary typically 60-70%
- State-specific rules may apply

### Agencies / Creative Firms
- Mix of owner labor and team leverage
- Salary typically 40-60%
- Depends on how much you're "doing the work" vs. managing

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Too Aggressive (Audit Risk)

**Client:** Solo consultant, $200K net income
**Their approach:** $40K salary (20%), $160K distributions
**Problem:** $40K is way too low for someone doing all the work
**IRS risk:** High—likely reclassification

**Better approach:**
- Salary: $100K (50%)
- Distributions: $100K (50%)
- Tax savings: still ~$15K/year vs. sole prop

### Example 2: Too Conservative (Overpaying Tax)

**Client:** Product-based business, $180K net income
**Their approach:** $120K salary (67%), $60K distributions
**Problem:** Overpaying payroll taxes

**Better approach:**
- Salary: $85K (47%)
- Distributions: $95K (53%)
- Additional savings: ~$5K/year

### Example 3: Just Right

**Client:** Creative agency, $250K net income, 2 other employees
**Approach:** $110K salary (44%), $140K distributions (56%)
**Rationale:**
- Comparable agency employees make $90-120K
- Owner does meaningful work but team delivers too
- Mix feels defensible

**Result:** IRS-defensible position, maximized tax savings

## How to Calculate Your Reasonable Salary

**Step 1:** Research comparable positions
- Check salary.com, Glassdoor, PayScale
- Ask "What would I pay someone to do my job?"
- Consider location (PNW vs. national average)

**Step 2:** Document your rationale
- Keep notes on how you arrived at your salary
- Track comparable positions
- Document your actual duties

**Step 3:** Adjust annually
- As profit grows, salary should grow (but not 1:1)
- Review each December for the following year

**Step 4:** Get professional input
- This is where a CPA adds real value
- We model different scenarios and recommend a defensible number

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Zero salary, all distributions
**Problem:** Instant IRS red flag
**Solution:** Always take some salary if doing meaningful work

### 2. Paying minimum wage
**Problem:** Not reasonable for skilled professionals
**Solution:** Pay what you'd pay someone else for your role

### 3. Never adjusting salary
**Problem:** As business grows, $50K salary becomes obviously unreasonable
**Solution:** Review and adjust annually

### 4. No documentation
**Problem:** Can't defend your position in an audit
**Solution:** Keep notes on how you set your salary

## Cash Flow Considerations

**Salary requires:**
- Payroll processing (quarterly or monthly)
- Payroll tax deposits (immediate)
- Consistent cash flow to meet payroll

**Distributions are flexible:**
- Take them when cash flow allows
- No minimum required
- Can vary by quarter

**Strategy for lumpy cash flow:**
- Set salary lower (but still reasonable)
- Take larger distributions in high-cash months

## Multi-Owner S-Corps

**Special considerations:**
- Each owner must take reasonable salary for *their* work
- Distributions can be split per ownership %
- One owner taking all distributions while others take salary = audit risk

**Example: 50/50 partners**
- Partner A: Does sales, strategy (40 hrs/week)
  - Salary: $80K
- Partner B: Does operations, delivery (40 hrs/week)
  - Salary: $80K
- Remaining profit: Split 50/50 as distributions

## When to Change Your Strategy

**Increase salary if:**
- Net income growing significantly
- Taking on more responsibilities
- Comparable positions show higher pay

**Consider distributions if:**
- Cash flow is lumpy (salary is fixed, distributions flexible)
- Tax savings justify the complexity
- You have capital basis to support distributions

## Getting Help

**DIY risks:**
- Under/overpaying yourself
- Poor documentation
- Audit vulnerability

**Working with a CPA:**
- We model different scenarios
- Provide written documentation of rationale
- Monitor IRS guidance changes
- Adjust as your business evolves

**Cost:** Included in monthly accounting or available as standalone analysis ($500)

## The Bottom Line

**Optimal owner pay strategy:**
1. Pay yourself a reasonable salary (40-60% of net income, depending on role)
2. Take remaining profit as distributions
3. Document your rationale
4. Adjust annually as business grows

**Tax savings:** $8K-20K+ per year for most S-Corps above $100K profit

**The sweet spot:** Aggressive enough to save taxes, conservative enough to avoid audit risk
