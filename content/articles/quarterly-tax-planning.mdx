Most founders think about taxes once a year—when their CPA calls in March asking for documents. By then, it's too late to do anything meaningful about your tax bill.

**Quarterly tax planning changes that.**

Instead of reacting to your tax liability after the year ends, you make proactive moves every quarter to minimize taxes and optimize cash flow.

## The Problem with Year-End Tax Planning

When you wait until December (or worse, April) to think about taxes:

1. **No time for strategies**: Most tax moves require action *during* the year
2. **Cash flow shock**: Large unexpected tax bills strain cash reserves
3. **Missed opportunities**: Timing-dependent deductions are lost
4. **Stress**: Last-minute scrambling vs. calm planning

## What Quarterly Tax Planning Looks Like

**Every quarter (typically by month-end), we:**

1. **Review YTD financials**: Where's your income trending?
2. **Calculate projected tax**: What's your estimated annual liability?
3. **Adjust estimated payments**: Are you paying enough (or too much)?
4. **Identify tax moves**: What strategies can reduce your bill?
5. **Plan owner compensation**: Optimize salary vs. distributions

**Time commitment:** 30-45 minute call + any action items

## Real Example: How This Saves Money

**Client: Seattle consulting firm**

### Without quarterly planning (old way):
- Year-end profit: $280K
- No planning, standard deductions
- Tax bill: $89,000
- "Surprise" cash flow hit in April

### With quarterly planning (our way):
- Q1: Realized profits trending high, accelerated equipment purchases ($25K)
- Q2: Increased retirement contributions (SEP-IRA, $42K)
- Q3: Adjusted estimated payments to avoid underpayment penalty
- Q4: Timed year-end expenses strategically
- **Final tax bill: $71,000**
- **Savings: $18,000**

## Key Tax Strategies We Review Quarterly

### 1. Retirement Contributions
- SEP-IRA (up to $66K for 2024)
- Solo 401(k) (up to $69K for 2024)
- Timing: can be made until tax deadline, but better to plan ahead

### 2. Equipment & Asset Purchases
- Section 179 deduction (up to $1.16M in 2024)
- Bonus depreciation
- Timing: must be placed in service by Dec 31

### 3. Owner Compensation
- S-Corp salary adjustments
- Distribution timing
- Estimated tax payment adjustments

### 4. Business Expenses
- Prepaying expenses (insurance, software, etc.)
- Year-end inventory decisions
- Travel and conference timing

### 5. Entity Structure
- S-Corp election timing (March 15 deadline)
- Multi-entity strategies for real estate or side businesses

## Estimated Tax Payments: Getting Them Right

**The IRS requires quarterly estimated payments if you'll owe $1,000+ in taxes.**

**Payment deadlines:**
- Q1: April 15
- Q2: June 15
- Q3: September 15
- Q4: January 15 (following year)

**Common mistakes:**
1. **Underpaying**: Leads to penalties (0.5% per month)
2. **Overpaying**: Giving the IRS an interest-free loan
3. **Equal payments**: When income is seasonal or lumpy

**Our approach:** Adjust each quarter based on actual performance

## WA & OR-Specific Considerations

### Washington
- No state income tax on distributions (S-Corp advantage)
- B&O tax quarterly filing
- L&I premiums (if you have employees)

### Oregon
- State estimated tax payments required
- Kicker credit (if state has surplus)
- Transit tax for Portland metro businesses

## How Much Does Quarterly Planning Cost?

**Standalone quarterly planning:** Typically $150-300 per session ($600-1,200/year)

**Included in our monthly accounting packages:** From $800/mo

**ROI:** Most clients save 5-10× the cost in reduced taxes and avoided penalties

## What You Need to Prepare

Before each quarterly call:
- Current P&L (we usually provide this)
- Any major upcoming expenses or investments
- Changes in business structure or revenue
- Personal tax considerations (W-2 income, side income, etc.)

## DIY vs. Professional Quarterly Planning

**Can you do this yourself?** Technically yes, but:

- Tax law changes frequently (hard to keep up)
- Emotional attachment (hard to be objective about your own business)
- Time cost (is your time worth $200/hour analyzing tax code?)
- Missed strategies (don't know what you don't know)

**When DIY makes sense:**
- Very simple business (<$50K profit)
- Standard deductions only
- No employees or contractors
- Sole proprietor with no entity complexity

## Common Objections (And Why They're Wrong)

### "I can't predict my income"
**Response:** That's exactly why you do it quarterly—adjust as you go

### "My CPA handles it"
**Response:** Most CPAs are reactive (tax prep) vs. proactive (planning)

### "I don't want to think about taxes that often"
**Response:** 45 minutes quarterly vs. a weekend in April—your choice

### "I'm too small to need this"
**Response:** If you're making $60K+ profit, you're not too small

## How to Get Started

1. **Book a discovery call**: Discuss your situation
2. **Q1 planning session**: We review your current year projections
3. **Quarterly cadence**: Schedule recurring sessions
4. **Execute strategies**: Take action between calls

Most clients start mid-year (no problem—better late than never).

## What About Safe Harbor?

**Safe harbor rules** let you avoid underpayment penalties if you pay:
- 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150K), OR
- 90% of current year tax

**Our take:** Safe harbor keeps you out of penalty trouble, but doesn't optimize your tax bill. We aim to do both.

## The Bottom Line

**Quarterly tax planning is the difference between:**
- Reactive (expensive, stressful) vs. Proactive (optimized, calm)
- Guessing vs. Knowing
- Surprise bills vs. Predictable cash flow

If you're making $60K+ in profit, you should have a quarterly tax planning system in place.
