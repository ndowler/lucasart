If you're a founder in Washington or Oregon making over $60K in net income, you've probably heard whispers about S-Corp election. Maybe your accountant mentioned it, or a fellow founder told you they're "saving thousands" on taxes.

**But should you actually elect S-Corp status?**

The short answer: *it depends*. Let's break down when it makes sense, when to wait, and how to calculate your potential savings.

## What Is S-Corp Election?

S-Corp election is a tax designation (not a business entity type) that changes how your LLC or corporation is taxed. Instead of paying self-employment tax on all your profit, you:

1. Pay yourself a "reasonable salary" (subject to payroll taxes)
2. Take remaining profit as distributions (not subject to SE tax)

The savings come from avoiding 15.3% self-employment tax on your distributions.

## When S-Corp Makes Sense

**You're likely a good candidate if:**

- Net income consistently above $60-80K
- Predictable revenue and cash flow
- Ability to pay yourself a reasonable W-2 salary
- Willing to run payroll quarterly or monthly
- Multi-year business (not brand new)

## The Math: Potential Savings

Let's look at a real example:

**Scenario: $150K net income**

### As a sole proprietor (or disregarded LLC):
- Self-employment tax: $150K × 15.3% = $22,950
- Federal income tax: ~$23,000 (varies by deductions)
- **Total tax: ~$45,950**

### As an S-Corp:
- Reasonable salary: $80K
- Distributions: $70K
- Payroll taxes on salary: $80K × 15.3% = $12,240
- Federal income tax: ~$23,000 (same)
- **Total tax: ~$35,240**

**Savings: ~$10,710 per year**

*Note: This is simplified. Your actual savings depend on your specific situation, state taxes, and deductions.*

## WA vs. OR: State Differences

### Washington
- No state income tax (distributions are tax-free at state level)
- B&O tax still applies to gross revenue
- S-Corp election is purely a federal SE tax play

### Oregon
- State income tax applies to both salary and distributions
- Less dramatic savings than WA, but still significant
- Still worth it above ~$80K net income

## When to Wait

**Hold off on S-Corp election if:**

- Net income below $50K (compliance costs eat the savings)
- Inconsistent or seasonal revenue
- You need high owner distributions (can't afford salary)
- Planning to raise venture capital (investors prefer C-Corp)
- First year in business (wait until you hit profitability)

## The Reasonable Salary Requirement

The IRS requires you to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" for the work you do. Too low, and you risk an audit and penalties.

**General rule of thumb:**
- For service businesses: 40-60% of net income
- For product businesses: 30-50% of net income
- Must be comparable to what you'd pay someone else for your role

## How to Elect S-Corp Status

1. **Form 2553**: File with the IRS (deadline: March 15 for current year, or within 75 days of formation)
2. **State registration**: Register with WA or OR if required
3. **Payroll setup**: Set up quarterly or monthly payroll
4. **Bookkeeping**: More complex than sole prop—consider professional help

## Cost vs. Savings

**Typical costs:**
- Payroll processing: $50-150/month
- Accounting fees: Additional $200-500/month (more complex books)
- Annual tax return (1120S): $800-1,500

**Break-even point:** Usually around $60-80K net income

## Our Recommendation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Electing too early**: Wait until you're consistently profitable
2. **Salary too low**: IRS red flag—pay yourself fairly
3. **Missing payroll deadlines**: Quarterly payroll taxes are non-negotiable
4. **Poor bookkeeping**: S-Corps require clean books for tax returns

2. Run the numbers (or use our S-Corp calculator)
